## 📌 Introduction
This repository is a **comprehensive collection of 20 containerization labs** designed to build strong foundational and advanced skills in working with containers.  
Starting from **basic image-building instructions** such as `FROM`, `RUN`, and `COPY`, the labs gradually move towards **multi-container applications, container orchestration, security practices, and troubleshooting techniques**.  
Each lab is structured to provide **hands-on learning**, ensuring that learners not only understand the concepts but also gain practical experience.  
By the end of these labs, you will be able to **design, build, secure, and deploy containerized applications** that are aligned with industry standards and best practices.
